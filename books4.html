<hl>Me Again</hl>
<p>
Hi it’s me Hazel the girl that doesn’t have a reason to live anymore.
<hl>Surgery Again</hl>
</p>
<hl>Surgery Again</hl>
<p>
I have to go into another surgery so last time I almost died. My dad actually died though. I wish I didn’t even go into that surgery because it killed my 
father and did nothing to help my sickness called pneumonia and my sickness is mixed with another virus called tetanus.That is why I had to go into surgery 
and now I have to go through it again. 
</p>
<hl>Life in Darkness</hl>
<p>
  My life is completely ruined. My father is gone I will have this sickness forever, and I never see my mom because she is always at work until 4:00am in the morning. 
  There is just a complete dark hole in my life. My dad was the only person who could help me to not be scared, the only person who could really help me, and now he’s gone. 
  I’m lost in darkness no one can help me now.
</p>
<hl>Mom</hl>
<p>
  Mom has moved, on sometimes it just feels like she doesn’t even remember dad or the way things used to be. I wish she would let me talk about him with 
  her but she doesn’t. Whenever I try to she always tells me to please stop and hides her face behind a tissue. Are family is just not the same anymore. 
</p>
<hl>Packing Up</hl>
<p>
I have to pack to go to the hospital. Do you have everything you need honey mom says. Yes i do mom I say trying to sound casual even though my voice cracks a little. 
I remembered last time I had to go into the surgery room that was the day dad died.
</p>
<hl>Surgery Room</hl>
<p>
  We’re here said my mom. Okay I said as I got out of the car. I wasn’t scared of dying I kind of wanted to. So I could see dad again. 
  Hazel it’s time to start your surgery the doctor said. 
</p>
<hl>Silence</hl>
<p>
  I can’t hear anything am I still in the hospital or am I somewhere else? Am I dead? Am I going to die? I have many questions that I don’t know the answer to. 
  I wish I got to say bye. 
</p>
<hl>Squint</hl>
<p>
   My eyes feel droopy. My head heavy. I couldn’t move was I going to be with my dad again? Or was I going to feel pain forever? I forced my eyes open to say goodbye. Mum?
</p>
<hl>Emergency</hl>
<p>
I closed my eyes again and I heard voices her heart isn’t beating!! Next thing I knew I was in a breathing machine. I was leaving the earth I could feel it. 
But was I? I might survive, even though most of hope was gone. All I said was mum I love you please take care of Crisp for me and that was it I was gone. 
Somewhere happier. Where I didn’t have to always be on the brink of death. That is or should I say was the end of my story.
