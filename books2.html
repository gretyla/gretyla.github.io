  <p>
    Hi my name is Jade. I can’t tell you my last name. It's too dangerous. These times you can’t trust anyone. I will tell you the story of how it happened and why.
  </p>
  <p>
      Hey mom it’s a nice day can I go see if Liz can play? Sure honey be back at five p.m. for dinner. Okay mom I’m going now. 
    Be safe sweety. I dashed through the door outside to Liz’s house. I knocked on the door. I’ll get it. I heard Liz say to her mom. 
    She opened the door. Oh hi Jade she said. Mom it’s Jade I saw her mom “come in” she said to me. Thanks I said as we went to Liz’s room. 
    Her real name was Elizibeth but she just went by Liz. So what's up she asked me. In her usual voice. 
    “Guess what” I said they’re going to enroll me in a play in Paris I said excitedly!!! Really she said questioningly? 
    Yes I said isn’t it so exciting I asked! Yeah sure she said sadly. What’s wrong I asked? I just really wanted to go do the play she said. 
    Sorry I know you will get the enrolling letter I said.
  </p>

   Then the doorbell rang and we both said at the same time I’ll get it. We laughed. But the thing that was behind the door did not make us laugh. 
   In fact it made us scream. What was it well I’ll get to that. But let me get on with the story. We ran and ran and hid. But it was too fast and it caught Liz. 
   I screamed and cried but kept running. I had to save Liz but I just couldn’t not right now. Right now I needed to hide so I could figure out a plan. 
   So I found a cave and hid. I hid for I don’t know how long. But when I came out it was sundown. My mom was gone. My dad was gone. 
   Liz was gone, where did that thing take them?

    <p>
       As I was saying, I need to make a plan, but how will I when I don’t know anything about that monster. 
      I’m going into the forbidden forest now even though my parents always told me to never go into that forest. I need to, it might have something to do 
      with the monster and Liz. I don’t know why but things are happening that shouldn’t. Like yesterday school was canceled for no reason. 
      What’s happening to our world I don’t know but what I do know is that it’s not right. I think just maybe this thing is trying to take over our world. 
      But I’m not going to let them. I’m not going to let them ruin everything and everyone. This is our world and I am going to save it. 
      Show those monsters that they can’t take away our lives without a fight.
