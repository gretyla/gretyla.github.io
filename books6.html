      Hi I’m Rubix yeah I know it’s a funny name but that’s my name. 
  People make fun of me all the time. Do you know why? 
  It’s because I have one blue eye and one green eye and a red nose. 
  That is why my owners named me Rubik’s. 
  Everyone makes fun of me because of that. 
  I wish I could be a normal cat that hunts mice and is proud. 
  But instead I talk to them. If I had three wishes 
  they would be to have a family, be a normal cat, 
  and have real friends (True Friends). Anyways I have to 
  go Herald my mouse friend is here. Bye.
  </p>
  <p>
        Yes, I’m a kitten but don’t judge us because of our age, 
    we still have as many problems as grown up cats. Like my 
    sister Zelli her legs don’t work very well. 
    She was born with that and was made fun of so much. 
    They called her two legs, no offense to you guys 
    who are reading this. But it’s very offensive to cats. 
    Even though probably for humans it’s fine. Gotta go. Bye.
  </p>
  <p>
        Well anyways gotta go get some cuddles at least someone 
    cares about me. Her name is Ruby. She loves me and 
    I love her we’re besties forever. Even though we’re 
    different like she’s a human and I’m a kitten, 
    and she’s got brown wavy hair and I have black straight fur. 
    We still are going to be Bffs forever no matter what. 
    I mean that’s what I hope. I better get going. Bye.
  </p>
    <p>
        So where did we end last time? Oh yeah I was talking 
      about Ruby. Ruby is so kind and she has a friend 
      named Jade, Jade has a white cat that is my only 
      cat friend. The white cat’s name is Sam, 
      Sam loves peas, sugar snap peas, field peas, 
      podded peas,burpee sugar snap, dundale peas,
      maestro shell peas, and any other peas you 
      could think of. She gets made fun of a lot too but 
      I would still rather love peas and get made fun of 
      than have a red nose, a green eye, and a blue eye 
      that are permanent and get made fun of my whole life. 
      Well anyway Sam and Jade are coming over soon 
      so I better get ready. Bye. 
  </p>
    <p>
          Hi I’m back, Rubik's here. I left off talking 
      about Sam and Jade and yes they came over. 
      I had so much fun with Sam that when she left it almost 
      felt like a part of my life was torn away. But I’m fine 
      it’s not like we’re Romeo and Juliet. We can’t see 
      each other forever. Besides were just friends. 
      We’re not like girlfriend and boyfriend ick. I hate it when 
      Ruby and Jade pretend that. It’s plain disgust. 
      But me and Sam are still friends no matter what. 
      We’ll I’ve got a dum vet appointment gotta run. Bye. 
  </p>
  <p>
          We’ll anyway at the Vet appointment I had to 
    get a shot because I’m allergic to some kind of flower 
    called a Sixto flower. It’s this flower that was named 
    after a famous singer back in the 1800’s. 
    But you know it’s not the 1800’s anymore so who cares 
    about him. I don’t. Anyways so yeah I had to get a shot. 
    But who cares about shots when the doctor gives you a 
    BATH I don’t think it’s even legal, to torture a poor kitty 
    with water. So I had to do something I had to defend cat kind. 
    But how? Well I scratched the doctors face, yes I scratched him. 
    But he still dunked me in that water no matter how hard 
    I tried to get out. Then it was finally over and Ruby’s 
    mom Mrs.Kensington/Mrs.K took me home. 
    Then she yelled at me for a while because I had scratched the doctor. 
    She told Ruby to get me out of the house, then she yelled some more. 
    Finally she said I’m done with this cat’s poor behavior 
    we’re taking him to the pound. NO Ruby screamed not the 
    pound I promise I’ll turn him into a good cat. 
    If you take him to the pound he won’t have any friends. 
    Well than he needs to stop behaving this way got it missy? 
    Yes I promise said Ruby. Oops dinner time 
    I’ll finish the story later. Bye.
