      Hi I’m Rubix yeah I know it’s a funny name but that’s my name. 
  People make fun of me all the time. Do you know why? 
  It’s because I have one blue eye and one green eye and a red nose. 
  That is why my owners named me Rubik’s. 
  Everyone makes fun of me because of that. 
  I wish I could be a normal cat that hunts mice and is proud. 
  But instead I talk to them. If I had three wishes 
  they would be to have a family, be a normal cat, 
  and have real friends (True Friends). Anyways I have to 
  go Herald my mouse friend is here. Bye.

        Yes, I’m a kitten but don’t judge us because of our age, 
    we still have as many problems as grown up cats. Like my 
    sister Zelli her legs don’t work very well. 
    She was born with that and was made fun of so much. 
    They called her two legs, no offense to you guys 
    who are reading this. But it’s very offensive to cats. 
    Even though probably for humans it’s fine. Gotta go. Bye.

        Well anyways gotta go get some cuddles at least someone 
    cares about me. Her name is Ruby. She loves me and 
    I love her we’re besties forever. Even though we’re 
    different like she’s a human and I’m a kitten, 
    and she’s got brown wavy hair and I have black straight fur. 
    We still are going to be Bffs forever no matter what. 
    I mean that’s what I hope. I better get going. Bye.

        So where did we end last time? Oh yeah I was talking 
      about Ruby. Ruby is so kind and she has a friend 
      named Jade, Jade has a white cat that is my only 
      cat friend. The white cat’s name is Sam, 
      Sam loves peas, sugar snap peas, field peas, 
      podded peas,burpee sugar snap, dundale peas,
      maestro shell peas, and any other peas you 
      could think of. She gets made fun of a lot too but 
      I would still rather love peas and get made fun of 
      than have a red nose, a green eye, and a blue eye 
      that are permanent and get made fun of my whole life. 
      Well anyway Sam and Jade are coming over soon 
      so I better get ready. Bye.
