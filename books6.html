    Hi I’m Rubix yeah I know it’s a funny name but that’s my name. 
  People make fun of me all the time. Do you know why? 
  It’s because I have one blue eye and one green eye and a red nose. 
  That is why my owners named me Rubik’s. 
  Everyone makes fun of me because of that. 
  I wish I could be a normal cat that hunts mice and is proud. 
  But instead I talk to them. If I had three wishes 
  they would be to have a family, be a normal cat, 
  and have real friends (True Friends).
