      My Name is Nina and this is my story.

  <p>
    I was just at my school. I had just began 3rd grade. When 20 German soldiers barged into the classroom. They grabbed our teacher and took her into a room . We were very afraid for we were only 8. That was the start of a very long war called world war ll that I needed to survive.

        It was dinner time but we barely had enough food for breakfast. But today I had a bad feeling that something was wrong. The war had started and me and my family could barely survive. The Germans had taken everything. Our food our water our beds our blankets. Even our clothing. We had almost nothing. All we had was a dirty old pot and a ragged blanket we had to share. My sister (Reveigh) who was two and my brother (Thomas) who was five had to have the thickest blankets so they could keep warm. I only had a small thin blanket and my parents had none. We were sad and hungry but that was only the start. Only a week later my parents were captured by a German guard. Me and Reveigh and Thomas were sent to a child concentration camp. Where we were to work every day from five in the morning through nine in the night.

      We were taken on a train to the camp. We were then sorted through age if you were to young you would either be shot, adopted by the Germans, or they would take your blood and give it to the German soldiers who were dying. I was sorted into the working group my brother was separated from me and put into the young workers group. “But Reveigh, Reveigh was put in the to young group. I screamed please don’t take Reveigh”. But no one listened to me. Except a  German guard who came up to me and whipped my face with a rope.

      We are supposed to get up at 5:00 a.m. But I accidentally slept in. And so I was almost shot. Today we will find out where we are going to work here. But I need to escape even though I know even if i do I will probably never find my family. I remember the times before this horrible war. When every night i would snuggle on daddy's lap and he would tell us stories of castles and knights. But those times were when all was safe and we had nothing to worry about. Then they took mom and shot dad. They made us watch our dad die. It was horrible. Time for us to be picked for work. They treat us like we are slaves. I am supposed to work in the sewing room. Which means I will be sewing all the German soldiers clothes.

        When i was little i used to sing beautiful tunes. And my mother would sing them with me. I loved to sing but then the soldiers came and i was to scared. But now i sing with the other girls as they tell me about their family. Tenia an eleven year old girl had to watch her parents be poisoned to death. She was only nine then. But she was sobbing while she told us. She had no one left. I didn’t know where my mom and brother were. I think my mother was shot. But I didn’t know if Reveigh was even alive. I was alone in this horrible war that we were stuck in.
