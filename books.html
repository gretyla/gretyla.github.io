  <h1>Nina</h1>
  <p>
      My Name is Nina and this is my story. 
  </p>
  <p>
      I was just at my school. 
    I had just began 3rd grade. 
    When 20 German soldiers 
    barged into the classroom. 
    They grabbed our teacher 
    and took her into a room. 
    We were very afraid for we 
    were only 8. That was the 
    start of a very long war called 
    world war ll that I needed to 
    survive. 
  </p>
  <p>
        It was dinner time but we 
    barely had enough food for breakfast. 
    But today I had a bad feeling 
    that something was wrong. 
    The war had started and me 
    and my family could barely survive. 
    The Germans had taken everything. 
    Our food our water our beds our blankets. 
    Even our clothing. We had almost nothing. 
    All we had was a dirty old pot 
    and a ragged blanket we had to share. 
    My sister (Reveigh) who was two 
    and my brother (Thomas) who was five had 
    to have the thickest blankets 
    so they could keep warm. I only had a small 
    thin blanket and my parents had none. 
    We were sad and hungry but that was 
    only the start. Only a week later my 
    parents were captured by a German guard. 
    Me and Reveigh and Thomas were sent to 
    a child concentration camp. 
    Where we were to work every day from 
    five in the morning through nine in the night.
  </p>
  <p>
      We were taken on a train to the camp. 
    We were then sorted through age if you 
    were to young you would either be shot, 
    adopted by the Germans, or they would 
    take your blood and give it to the 
    German soldiers who were dying. 
    I was sorted into the working group 
    my brother was separated from me and 
    put into the young workers group. 
    “But Reveigh, Reveigh was put 
    in the to young group. I screamed 
    please don’t take Reveigh”. 
    But no one listened to me. 
    Except a  German guard who came up to 
    me and whipped my face with a rope. 
  </p>
  <p>
      We are supposed to get up at 5:00 a.m. 
    But I accidentally slept in. And so I was almost shot.
    Today we will find out where we are going to 
    work here. But I need to escape even though I know 
    even if i do I will probably never find my 
    family. I remember the times before this horrible war. 
    When every night i would snuggle on daddy's
    lap and he would tell us stories of castles and knights. 
    But those times were when all was safe 
    and we had nothing to worry about. 
    Then they took mom and shot dad. 
    They made us watch our dad die. 
    It was horrible. Time for us to be picked 
    for work. They treat us like we are slaves. 
    I am supposed to work in the sewing room. 
    Which means I will be sewing all the 
    German soldiers clothes.
  </p>
  <p>
           When i was little i used to sing beautiful tunes. And my mother would sing them with me. 
    I loved to sing but then the soldiers came and i was to scared. But now i sing with the other girls 
    as they tell me about their family. Tenia an eleven year old girl had to watch her parents be poisoned to death. 
    She was only nine then. But she was sobbing while she told us. She had no one left. 
    I didn’t know where my mom and brother were. I think my mother was shot. But I didn’t know if Reveigh
    was even alive. I was alone in this horrible war that we were stuck in. 
  </p>
  <p>
        It was 5:00 o'clock in the morning and I heard a very loud sound it sounded like a firework. 
    But a few seconds later the roof came crashing down. And i was still in the building. 
    I rushed out but i was too late it fell on top of me. 
  </p>
  <p>
        When I woke up I was in some kind of hospital but everything was blurry. 
    Then i looked closer and I could see a nurse standing over me. 
    She was looking at me and checking my pulse. “Where am I” i asked?The nurse answered 
    “you are in the German Hospital. No I can’t be this is the place where they take children’s
    blood out of their bodies then they kill them. 
    Stay calm your injured we are only healing you. 
    We wouldn’t take your blood you are a worker. 
    But yes some of us take the blood out of young children 
    because they are useless.  
  </p>
  <p>
        The Germans are switching our work. I am going to be at the metal 
    factory where we make bombs for the Germans. But I am definitely not making any
    bomb for the Germans, for the enemy. The ones who captured me. 
    They tied our hands with ropes and if we squirmed the would hammer nails in our feet. 
    So I didn’t squirm i have to listen to them if I want to stay alive. 
    They are leading our small group to the Metal Works building.  The Metal Works factory 
    is where hundreds of slaves worked and made bombs, bullets, and armor for German Soldiers. 
    But even though I didn’t want to I worked and made hundreds of bombs. Even though 
    i was closely watched by the soldiers when they weren’t looking I would sometimes 
    sneak some dirt inside the bomb instead of gunpowder. 
  </p>
  <p>
        Today I kept hearing bombs in the night. I couldn’t sleep. I had a sprained
    ankle and lice. I was sobbing I missed when everything was normal, I missed my family. 
    Apparently Sarina heard me she came over and gave me a hug. She was like the 
    older sister i had always wished for. But in reality we were all in the middle of Dark Sadness. 
    Then I heard it, the sound of a bomb. It was bigger than the last. I knew it was a 
    bomb this time though so I rushed out to the freezing winter night in my rags of clothing. 
    But Tesha didn’t make it. I screamed “Tesha hurry” but it was too late she was gone. 
  </p>
  <p>
        Sarina found a gun. She told me to stay inside the Metal works factory. 
    I did for three minutes and then I just went out. She was aiming the gun at a German Soldier! 
    But he was aiming to. The soldier shot she shot to they both fell down. I ran towards her 
    “no  Sarina come back” I yelled! But i new she was already gone, dead. I fell onto the 
    ground and cried for a long while. But I knew I couldn’t do anything to help her now. 
    I walked over to the spot where her body laid. I heard her say take my shoes and
    then she never said a word again. Feelings overwhelmed me with sadness distress and anger. 
  </p>
  <p>
      My memory I can barely remember. The only memory I have from my Mother is when
    I was two years old she sang me a song it went like this.”come little children 
    rest after day don’t worry when it’s morn you can go out to play rock away the 
    sadness of the day don’t be worried I’m right by you in your heart”. She had brown 
    eyes and dark red hair. And my dad would always tell me stories of princesses and warriors. 
    He had Brown hair and blue eyes. I miss them so much. 
  </p>
  <p>
      How long will this horrible war last. How long until I die. How long tell I will ever get 
    to see my family again. If I ever do. There is so many questions I have that will never be answered. 
    I am starting to forget the purpose of life. Were we just to live so we could die? 
    Or were we to live so we could have a family that cared that was with you. 
  </p>
  <p>
      Every night I have to cry myself to sleep. I will never know if I will see any 
    of my family again. I am wondering when I can see happiness again and not be stuck 
    in this war of death sadness, and  anger. 
  </p>
  <p>
      If I had one wish I could make on anything I would wish that the war was over. That no one would
    have to live in complete darkness over the Germans anymore. That we could be free and live our own life. 
    So we could be happy again. So I could maybe see my family. But no matter how much 
    i wish it will never come true.
  </p>
  <p>
      It was 10;00 pm and me and the others were in bed all of them were asleep, except me. 
    I couldn’t go to sleep. I was to afraid. I couldn’t fall asleep i missed  Sarina why 
    did she have to shoot, why couldn’t i die in her place. I don’t know what to do anymore. 
    I can barely remember my mother and father.When will i see my family again 
    I don’t know what will happen anymore nobody does. I’ve been weeping for 3 hours now. 
    I can’t figure out why the lord took Sarina away from me. She was like my sister. 
  </p>
  <p>
      The ground is moving and our beds are too. I don’t know what is happening right now. 
    I think it’s another BOMB! Wake up Hellen, Emma, Valentina, Vuronica, Amidy. WAKE UP! 
    There’s another bomb I think everybody OUT! Hurry up. But it wasn’t a bomb it was a hurricane. 
    A hurricane that many would not survive.
  </p>
   <p>
        We need to go to escape. Leave somewhere else but I can’t i can’t just leave. 
     I need to stay and try to find my family. Go I told Helen and Emma. Leave, 
     escape i said. “But what about you Nina”, they said. I’ll be fine I said. You need to 
     leave now GO! I told them. Okay we’re going. Goodbye stay safe Nina your kindness 
     will always be with us they said. It won’t be the last time i see you now goodbye i said. 
   </p>
   <p>
         KNOCK knock, that’s what I  heard on the girls dorms door. I nervously opened the door. 
     It was an American Soldier! W-who are you I stuttered. I am an American Soldier 
     i have come to take you home. You are free now. We have won the war. He took me to German 
     houses and he ordered the german families to give me there food because the german’s 
     stole everything from us during the war. I was free I couldn’t believe it. 
   </p>
  <p>
        I found my brother Thomas but Reveigh died. I cried for hours but I 
    knew nothing would change it. She was dead.  Nothing would  change it. 
    She was gone, forever.
   </p>
   <p>
         I’ve found what’s left of my family. Thomas and my mother. We are 
     happy again now nothing could happen to split us apart.
   </p>
    <p>
        It turns out that there was a sickness from the war called seraque. You get red burns all over 
      you and a poison is in the virus. Nobody has survived it. I will probably die to. There is a 
      1% chance that I will survive. I’m in a hospital bed. I can’t get up i’m to weak. I’m going to die. 
      Clarise my best friend came to visit, I said Clarice if I die tell my parents goodbye for me.
   </p>
   <p>
         Nina’s Mother wept so did her little brother but they knew nothing would help her sickness.
     Nina had lived through world war ll and survived but she could not survive this sickness. 
     The doctor finally said I’m sorry Mrs.Johnson but your daughter Nina has died. 
     Nina had tried hard to survive and to fight but her body finally gave up.
   </p>
   <p>
     There were many deaths during this time, it was a time of loss and darkness. 
     Nina was one of the few who survived, I hope you liked this fictional world war ll book.
