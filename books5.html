  Hi
</p>
<p>
      Hi my name is Kayla and I want to tell you about when I had to move. 
</p>
<p>
  Me
</p>
<p>
      I’m 11 years old and I’m moving. I know everyone's always like that’s no big deal but to me it is. 
  I won’t be able to see any of my friends or do anything else that I used to. I’m bad at making friends and I’ll be going to middle school next year. 
  I know it’s kind of weird but at my old school they had sixth grade in elementary. In my new school I’ll be in sixth grade in middle school! 
  I can’t tell you how hard it is to know that your moving and still try to be happy. 
  At least I know how to be fake happy.

  The Day
</p>
<p>
  The day my mom told me that we were moving was a horrible day. I had woke up and it was raining and thundering.
  My mom creaked the door open. Moooooom it’s saturday can’t you give it a rest I said as I yawned. Kayla I need to talk to you about something mom said.  
  I got scared, she was using her serious voice. What I said. Kayla we’re going to move. WHAT I yelled. 
  I know it happened so suddenly but your father got a job offer and we talked it over and decided that it was the best thing for 
  our family so Kayla please don’t be mad. Don’t be mad you are just ruining my life and you tell me to not be mad! First we moved to 
  Tennessee and now we’re going to move again. It was hard enough moving from california to tennessee. 
  Now we’re moving again so I will have to make new friends again. Mom where are we moving I asked? We’re moving to Canada. 
  Canada is a different country mom, we can’t live there I’ll never see my friends here again! I know sweetie but your dad got a job offer and he took it mom said. 
  So you guys didn’t tell me till last minute? Yes and we are sorry mom said. Yeah right if you were sorry you should have told me before you decided. 
  Kayla don’t you dare be like that we made that decision and it was none of your business! Yes it is, it’s my business where my 
  life is going and where I’m going to live I said back. 
  Get packed up miss sass we’re moving in a week so time to say goodbyes and pack everything up.
