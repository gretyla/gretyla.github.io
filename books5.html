  Hi
</p>
<p>
      Hi my name is Kayla and I want to tell you about when I had to move. 
</p>
<p>
  Me
</p>
<p>
      I’m 11 years old and I’m moving. I know everyone's always like that’s no big deal but to me it is. 
  I won’t be able to see any of my friends or do anything else that I used to. I’m bad at making friends and I’ll be going to middle school next year. 
  I know it’s kind of weird but at my old school they had sixth grade in elementary. In my new school I’ll be in sixth grade in middle school! 
  I can’t tell you how hard it is to know that your moving and still try to be happy. 
  At least I know how to be fake happy.

  The Day
</p>
<p>
  The day my mom told me that we were moving was a horrible day. I had woke up and it was raining and thundering.
  My mom creaked the door open. Moooooom it’s saturday can’t you give it a rest I said as I yawned. Kayla I need to talk to you about something mom said.  
  I got scared, she was using her serious voice. What I said. Kayla we’re going to move. WHAT I yelled. 
  I know it happened so suddenly but your father got a job offer and we talked it over and decided that it was the best thing for 
  our family so Kayla please don’t be mad. Don’t be mad you are just ruining my life and you tell me to not be mad! First we moved to 
  Tennessee and now we’re going to move again. It was hard enough moving from california to tennessee. 
  Now we’re moving again so I will have to make new friends again. Mom where are we moving I asked? We’re moving to Canada. 
  Canada is a different country mom, we can’t live there I’ll never see my friends here again! I know sweetie but your dad got a job offer and he took it mom said. 
  So you guys didn’t tell me till last minute? Yes and we are sorry mom said. Yeah right if you were sorry you should have told me before you decided. 
  Kayla don’t you dare be like that we made that decision and it was none of your business! Yes it is, it’s my business where my 
  life is going and where I’m going to live I said back. 
  Get packed up miss sass we’re moving in a week so time to say goodbyes and pack everything up. 
</p>
<p>
 Packing to Move 
</p>
<p>
   So I’m packing up because we’re moving I’ve yelled and complained literally the whole day but I finally gave up. 
  I’ve realised that no matter how hard I try we’re still going to move. So what is the point of even trying. I sadly stared at my window for a long time. 
  Then I said I’ll miss you Tennessee I’ll miss your rain, I’ll miss your dying heat, I’ll miss your cold winters. I’ll miss you. 
  I wonder what will happen when I move to my friends? Will they just forget about me and get on with life? Or will they care and text and call me all the time? 
  Will I be happy in Canada or will I never be happy again? I mean last time I moved I made friends very easily but that was when 
  I was 6 now I’m 11 will I even be able to make friends? I don’t want to be a new girl again.

  Last Day
</p>
<p>
      Today is our last day here in Tennessee. I loved it here the fresh breeze at 6 pm that blows, I love the way the ocean liked to wave at me, 
  I’m going to miss it. I’ll miss my friends, my house, my teachers, the beach, I’ll miss everything. 
</p>
<p>
Goodbyes
</p>
